# DeuceGear.ObjectExtensions

Extension pack targeting objects

## DeepClone

object.Deepclone() creates a duplicate of the objects including it's children.
The current version does not copy defined delegates in the objects.
Once a child object is cloned a reference is kept, so an object is not cloned more than once.
As deepcloning is a tricky business, use with care.
